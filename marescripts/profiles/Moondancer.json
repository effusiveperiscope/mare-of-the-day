    "profile": "Moondancer is a female unicorn pony with a light gray coat, red mane with purple streaks, and purple eyes. Her cutie mark is a crescent moon with three stars. She is introduced as a filly in flashbacks, and later reappears as an adult who has become a reclusive academic, living in a dilapidated house and shunning social interaction.\n\nInitially heartbroken by Twilight Sparkle's rejection of her party invitation in their youth, Moon Dancer eventually overcomes her resentment and embraces friendship once more, thanks to Twilight's efforts to amend their past. She is then seen participating in social activities with other ponies, attending important events, and even joining in the final battle against the series' antagonists.\n",
    "quotes": [
        "Why won't you leave me alone? I'm trying to study! You've got the wrong pony! I don't have parties!",
        "\u201cTo my friend, Twilight Sparkle. Thanks for introducing me to the classics.\u201d I can see by the fact that you left it here that it meant a lot to you.",
        "Dah! I gave friendship a chance a long time ago! It didn't work out then, it isn't gonna work out now!",
        "Thank you for helping me make some new friends. Even if they are my old friends."
