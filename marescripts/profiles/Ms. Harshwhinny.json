    "profile": "Ms. Harshwhinny is an orange-coated Earth pony mare with light amber mane and light cerulean eyes. As the head of the Equestria Games, she's known for her strict adherence to rules and pursuit of perfection. Despite her stern and sometimes irritable demeanor, she possesses a hidden softer side, evident in her enthusiasm for the Cutie Mark Crusaders and dedication to the Games' success. She has a unique facial structure with a longer muzzle and shorter ears, often seen with a grumpy expression.\n\nMs. Harshwhinny interacts with the main characters primarily in her official capacity. She initially clashes with Rainbow Dash over professionalism but displays genuine appreciation for talent. She also guides Spike, albeit with a touch of sarcasm. Her interactions reveal a character who, despite her rigid exterior, is capable of recognizing and valuing extraordinary effort and achievement.\n",

        "Ms. Dash, will you please curb your over-enthusiastic outbursts?",
        "Acceptable? Acceptable?! Why, it was totally stupendously the single most amazing thing I've ever seen!",
        "Every city and empire wants to host the Equestria Games. So I have to go through all the big phony-baloney song and dance, though of course I'm never getting the real inside scoop.",
        "Princess Cadance? So, this is where you've been! I will have you know this is by far the worst welcome I've had in all my years!",
        "Ms. Peachbottom, I just finished hearing about how this pony was just treated to the warmest, finest, most fabulous reception she ever had. Courtesy of these fine ponies right here. Which, in my expert opinion, amounts to the first ever unvarnished, unrehearsed, and unbiased appraisal of a potential host of the Equestria Games."
