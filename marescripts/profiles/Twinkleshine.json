        "There you are, Twilight. Moon Dancer is having a little get-together at the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?",
        "Does that pony do anything except study? I think she's more interested in books than friends.",
        "We saw you at the coronation. That was some shindig!",
        "Of course. We wouldn't miss one of our best friends' parties.",
        "Really exquisite!"
