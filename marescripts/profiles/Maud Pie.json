    "profile": "Maud Pie is an Earth pony mare with a bluish-gray coat, grayish blue-violet mane and tail, and light turquoise eyes often depicted half-closed. Known for her notably neutral expression and monotonous tone, Maud's personality is in stark contrast to her bubbly sister, Pinkie Pie. Despite her apathetic demeanor, she displays sharp intelligence, particularly regarding geology, and exhibits surprising feats of strength when motivated. Maud resides in a crystal cave near Ponyville, having moved from her family's Pie Family Rock Farm, and works as both a geologist and a stand-up comedian.\n\nMaud is the older sister of Limestone Pie, Pinkie Pie, and Marble Pie, and is the daughter of Igneous Rock and Cloudy Quartz. She demonstrates a deep love and concern for her sister Pinkie, often participating in Pinkie's interests despite her own preferences. While she may struggle to connect with others due to her unique interests, she also genuinely values her close friends, such as Starlight Glimmer and, notably, Mudbriar, her boyfriend. Maud's cutie mark is a sharply diamond-shaped rock.\n",
