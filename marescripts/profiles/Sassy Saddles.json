    "profile": "Sassy Saddles is a thin female unicorn pony with a pale blue coat, a vermilion and orange mane, and eyes of a light orange hue. She is the manager of the Canterlot Carousel boutique and known for using alliteration related to clothing when expressing her emotions. Initially, she is depicted as an overbearing manager who prioritizes profit over Rarity's creative vision, leading to conflict.\n\nOver time, Sassy learns to respect Rarity's artistic principles and becomes a more supportive colleague. She assists Rarity with various fashion endeavors, like the femme mystique chic line. While briefly affected by King Sombra's influence, she ultimately participates in significant events such as Twilight Sparkle's coronation, demonstrating her reintegration into Canterlot society and her continued association with Rarity.",
