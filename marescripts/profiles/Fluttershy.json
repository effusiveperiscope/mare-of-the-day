She is best known for her kind and gentle personality, and possesses a deep love and empathy for animals, which is reflected in her occupation as an animal caretaker residing in a cottage near the Everfree Forest. Fluttershy's shy nature sometimes makes it difficult for her to interact with others, but she is also capable of great assertiveness and even anger when her friends or animals are threatened.\n\nFluttershy is one of the core members of the main group of ponies, representing the element of kindness and often interacting with her friends. She has some notable relations, including her brother Zephyr Breeze and pet bunny Angel, whose bossy personality sometimes clashes with her own.
