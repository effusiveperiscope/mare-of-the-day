    "profile": "Starlight Glimmer is a unicorn pony with a pale, light purple coat, moderate purple mane with lighter highlights, and moderate blue eyes. Initially, she was the leader of a village that believed in equality through the removal of cutie marks. This philosophy stemmed from her own experience with her childhood friend Sunburst, whom she felt abandoned her after gaining his cutie mark. After failing to change the past and accepting her own flawed actions which originally created the situation. She transitioned from being Twilight Sparkle's student to the guidance counselor and finally principal of the School of Friendship.\n\nStarlight started off as friendly but later became callous and often disrespectful to authority while desperately trying to maintain control. Over time, she demonstrated increasing confidence and a greater ability to be a good friend. She is shown to be extremely skilled in the use of magic, but often over-relies on it and sometimes struggles with temper issues. She is known for her dedication to the students at the School of Friendship.\n",
    "quotes": [
        "When the rest of Equestria sees that a princess gave up her cutie mark to join us, they'll finally understand what we're trying to accomplish.",
        "Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could have had otherwise!",
        "I know what it's like to lead by fear and intimidation! And I know what it's like to want everypony to do what you say! But I was wrong. A real leader doesn't force her subjects to deny who they are! She celebrates what makes them unique and listens when one of them finds a better way!",
        "I know there's no excuse for what I did, but I want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair.",
        "Hey, you made me a guidance counselor. That means tough love."
