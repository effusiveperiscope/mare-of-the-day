    "profile": "Sapphire Shores is a famous Earth pony pop star from Canterlot, known as \"The Pony of Pop.\" She has a pale gold coat, a light blue mane with azure streaks, and light amber eyes. Sapphire Shores is depicted as a parody of a self-promoting star, speaking with a loud, theatrical voice and incorporating musical intonations. Despite her fame and over-the-top mannerisms, she's shown to be friendly and approachable when interacting with ponies like Rarity.\n\nAs a client of Rarity, Sapphire Shores commissions garments for her tours, such as \"Sapphire Shores' Zigfilly Follies.\" She values unique designs, as evidenced by her appreciation for Sweetie Belle's dolphin-shaped stitching on a costume. Sapphire is a well-known figure in Canterlot's high society, making cameo appearances in various episodes alongside other prominent ponies. Some of her popular songs include \"Get Your Pony On\" and \"Serves Her Right.\"\n",

        "Oh, please, call me Sapphire.",
        "It's a dolphin! That's my lucky animal! They swim with me in my dreams.",
        "Phew... Mine carting is hard work for a sensational pony-pop icon like me! But as the mare's tale says, to be the best you've got to practice, practice, practice!",
        "I've been asking very politely, but you haven't found me ANYTHING for my new dress! i've got to be on the stage in a few hours!!! What am I going to wear?! One of my 437 other dresses?! everyone's already seen them!",
        "These... these are beautiful... Laughter, generosity, kindness... Oh, I'm so sorry! I haven't shown ANY of those things! Thank you for helping me find something so much more important than a dress: true friends."
