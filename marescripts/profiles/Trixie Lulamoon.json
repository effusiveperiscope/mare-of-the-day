    "profile": "Trixie Lulamoon is a brilliant azure unicorn with a pale blue mane and violet eyes. She began as a traveling magician with a flamboyant, boastful personality, often referring to herself as \"The Great and Powerful Trixie.\" Initially antagonistic towards Twilight Sparkle, Trixie was arrogant and prone to exaggerating her magical abilities, but after several humbling experiences, she started to display a more sincere and apologetic nature, embarking on an \"apology tour\" of Equestria.\n\nOver time, Trixie has developed a close friendship with Starlight Glimmer. She has also been a valuable ally, even working as a guidance counselor at the School of Friendship. Though still theatrical and prone to panic in dangerous situations, Trixie has consistently demonstrated genuine acts of courage and a willingness to help others. Her magic skills have improved as time went on, eventually reaching a point of teleporting objects.\n",
    "quotes": [
        "I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians: anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone? Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived!?!",
        "Everypony deserves a second chance\u2014even a third chance!",
        "Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget.",
        "Starlight. You got us this far with just my illusions and Discord's annoying personality. You don't need magic to figure out what to do next. I know you're afraid to be in charge, but you are really good at it! Listen to your best friend.",
        "And you, Miss Seed\u2014thank you. You reminded me that we don't have to be bad forever. Everypony deserves a second chance."
