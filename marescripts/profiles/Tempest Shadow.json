    "profile": "Tempest Shadow, originally named Fizzlepop Berrytwist, is a female unicorn pony with a dark orchid coat, a two-toned rose mane, and moderate opal eyes. A broken horn and a scar across her right eye mark her past as the former second-in-command to the Storm King. Initially portrayed as cold, merciless, and spiteful, she prioritized restoring her horn above all else, displaying a disdain for friendship and a willingness to use others. She serves as a secondary antagonist in *My Little Pony The Movie*.\n\nHowever, after the Storm King betrayed her, and Twilight Sparkle saved her, witnessing Twilight's kindness lead to a significant change of heart, prompting her to sacrifice herself to defeat the Storm King. Post-redemption, Tempest journeys across Equestria to atone for her misdeeds but retains a blunt and cynical demeanor. She grapples with feelings of displacement, a fear of Ursa Minors stemming from her childhood trauma, and relishes challenging battles, forming a bond with Rockhoof over their shared love for combat. \n",
    "quotes": [
        "Oh, I'm so glad you asked. How about we start with your complete and total surrender?",
        "That princess is not gonna keep me from getting my horn back!",
        "I saw the truth. My \"friends\" abandoned me when times got tough. Looks like I'm not the only one. Face it, princess. Friendship has failed you, too.",
        "I lost what I defined myself to be... Then I lost those who stood by me... And now, I'm simply... lost. I feel as though there is almost nothing left of me. Out here, I'll either lose myself completely... or find something new to be.",
        "I think \"bad luck\" is superstition. I don't blame curses. Everything bad that's happened to me... has been someone's fault. Sometimes mine."
