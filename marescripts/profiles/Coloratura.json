    "profile": "Coloratura, also known as Rara and Countess Coloratura, is a female Earth pony pop star. As a filly, she has a kind and friendly personality and a talent for singing. She has a light aquamarine-gray coat, a mane with dark gray-indigo, dark indigo, and cyan colors, and opal eyes. She was childhood friends with Applejack, who nicknamed her Rara.\n\nAs an adult, she initially presents as an aloof diva due to the influence of her manager, Svengallop. However, beneath the surface, she retains her love for charity work and connecting with young ponies. After confronting Svengallop's manipulations with Applejack's help, Coloratura rediscovers her true self and passion for music, embracing a more authentic stage presence.\n",

        "Absolutely not. My favorite part of any event is meeting with the schoolponies!",
        "I am not Rara! I am Countess Coloratura! And while we may have been friends when we were young, we have clearly gone in different directions!",
        "You clearly don't understand the real me!",
        "Of course. After all, the show must go on!",
        "This song may be familiar, but yet, it's totally different. Kind of like me, Rara."
