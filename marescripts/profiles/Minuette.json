    "profile": "Minuette is a bubbly and friendly female unicorn pony, known for her talkative nature and forgiving attitude. She has a light cornflower blue coat, periwinkle mane and tail streaked with blue, and dark blue eyes. Her cutie mark is an hourglass. Minuette is depicted as a recurring background character throughout the series, often appearing alongside her friends Twinkleshine and Lemon Hearts, but is first explicitly named in the episode \"Amending Fences\".\n\nMinuette is shown to be a kind and understanding pony, easily making new friends and forgiving old ones. Before Twilight Sparkle moved to Ponyville, she and Minuette were close friends in Canterlot. She is seen in many social gatherings and events throughout Equestria, like Wonderbolt performances or fashion shows. She is seen to travel all over Equestria, appearing at events in ponyville, Canterlot, and Appleloosa. This indicates she is one of the more sociable and ubiquitously present recurring characters in the show.\n",

        "Twilight Sparkle! You old so-and-so! What are you doing here?! Hey, Spike! Look at these wings, huh?! Hey, grab a picture of me and the princess, will ya?! I tried to tell my co-workers we used to be friends back when. But they've never believed me!",
        "Oh, come on, Twilight! Sure, it might've stung a little bit when you ran off to Ponyville without saying goodbye, but it's not like we weren't used to that from you!",
        "We were your friends then, and we would be honored to be your friends now.",
        "My cutie mark? It means that I make friends in no time flat, obviously! Oh, and that whole time magic thing I guess. Mostly it's the friend making.",
        "I'm a total sucker for slapstick comedy. That time Lemon Hearts got her head stuck in a beaker might have been the single best day of my entire foalhood!"
