    "profile": "Daring Do, also known as A.K. Yearling, is a light gold-coated Pegasus pony with a grayscale rainbow mane and brilliant rose eyes. As a treasure hunter and author, she's known for her cunning, fierce determination, and intelligence. Daring Do is skilled at solving puzzles and escaping traps but tends to be a loner who initially rejects help, stemming from the secrecy of her dangerous adventures. Over time, she begins to accept assistance from others, even developing a close bond with Rainbow Dash and co-writing a book with her rival, Dr. Caballeron.\n\nInitially introduced through her adventure novels, where the main characters admire her bravery and exploits, Daring Do's stories mirror her own real-life escapades. While reckless at times, she shows genuine regret for the damage her actions cause and, despite a rivalry, she's willing to work alongside Dr. Caballeron to achieve a common goal. Though she starts out mistrusting, she eventually learns the value of friendship and collaboration, even agreeing to protect artifacts rather than steal them.\n",
