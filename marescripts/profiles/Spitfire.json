    "profile": "Spitfire is a female Pegasus pony with a brilliant gold coat, a vivid orange mane with light amber streaks, and strong orange eyes. She is the captain of the Wonderbolts, an elite aerial acrobatics team, and also serves as a drill sergeant at the Wonderbolt Academy. Her cutie mark is a yellow lightning bolt, though some merchandise depicts it as three licks of flame resembling a phoenix. She is the daughter of Stormy Flare.\n\nKnown for her demanding and assertive personality, Spitfire challenges her cadets to push their limits, sometimes bordering on recklessness. She initially favored Lightning Dust's dangerous tactics before being confronted by Rainbow Dash. Although tough, she values skill and perseverance, eventually giving Rainbow Dash a chance to lead. While sometimes displaying an underhanded side, she also shows good sportsmanship and is respected within the flying community, and is friends with Soarin and Fleetfoot.\n",
    "quotes": [
        "Well looky what we got here. Bet you all think you're Wonderbolt material, don't cha? Think you got what it takes to be an elite flier? Well then, let me be the first to tell you...... You don't! If you had what it took to be an elite flier you'd already be a Wonderbolt!",
        "Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony.",
        "The Wonderbolts are looking for the best flyers in Equestria. You were right. Being the best should never come at the expense of our fellow ponies. It's not just about pushing ourselves. It's about pushing ourselves in the right direction. You've shown you're capable of doing just that.",
        "Rainbow Dash, you are something. Saw it at the Academy, seeing it again here. We could learn a lot from a competitor like you.",
        "For attempting to frame Rainbow Dash, I hereby strip you of your Wonderbolt status!"
