    "profile": "Lightning Dust is a female Pegasus pony with a light opal coat, brilliant amber and vivid gamboge mane, and brilliant gamboge eyes. Her cutie mark is a lightning bolt with three stars, and she leaves a blue and yellow thunderbolt streak when flying. She is portrayed as vigorous and highly competitive, always eager to push her limits in flight. However, this drive has made her reckless and inconsiderate, with a large ego, leading to her downfall.\n\nInitially a friend to Rainbow Dash at the Wonderbolt Academy, Lightning Dust's recklessness and disregard for safety resulted in her expulsion, fostering resentment towards Rainbow Dash, who replaced her as team leader. Later, she formed The Washouts, a stunt team performing dangerous feats, and even recruited Scootaloo, displaying a continued lack of concern for others' well-being. In the end, she declares herself and Rainbow Dash as rivals for life.\n",
    "quotes": [
        "Ma'am, can you put the Dizzitron on maximum speed? I wanna push my limits.",
        "They should make us Wonderbolts right now.",
        "Hey, you snooze, you lose! Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed to be able to recover from a spinout. You saw them on the Dizzitron. They could use the practice. I mean, it's not our fault we're so much better than those other guys. Not every pony is destined to become a Wonderbolt. Only the best of the best, right?",
        "RIVALS FOR LIFE!!",
        "You know, I outraced Rainbow Dash at every turn. I just had the guts to do what needed to be done to win and she cared more about making friends. Why does a Wonderbolt need friends? I should be a Wonderbolt right now and she should be the one sitting here."
