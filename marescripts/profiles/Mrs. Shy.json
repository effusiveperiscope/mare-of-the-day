    "profile": "Mrs. Shy is a timid and soft-spoken Pegasus mare with a pale amber coat, moderate raspberry mane, and cerise eyes. Like her husband, she is less assertive than her daughter Fluttershy, even considering Fluttershy to be the bolder of the two. She is a gardener by hobby who deeply loves her children.\n\nAs parents, both she and her husband are submissive, and can be easily taken advantage of by their son, Zephyr Breeze. Despite his behavior, they are proud of Zephyr's accomplishments. Mrs. Shy, in particular, has a false impression concerning Zephyr's relationships with others; such as thinking Rainbow Dash loves him. Together with her husband, she relies on Fluttershy to help them stand up to Zephyr.\n",

        "Zephyr's just trying to find his place, dear.",
        "Thank you, dear, for not giving up on Zephyr. After all these years of pining for him, it must be so satisfying to see him on the right track.",
        "You look so handsome!"
