    "profile": "Cloudy Quartz is an Earth pony mare and member of the Pie family, residing on a rock farm with her husband, Igneous Rock Pie, and their daughters, Limestone Pie, Maud Pie, Pinkie Pie, and Marble Pie. She has a pale gray coat, grayish-green mane, and blue eyes. Initially depicted as stoic and serious, bordering on emotionless, Cloudy Quartz, alongside Igneous, embodies a traditional, almost Amish-like demeanor.\n\nDespite their reserved nature, Cloudy Quartz demonstrates kindness and love for her family. She has been shown to let loose and enjoy herself, such as when Pinkie Pie threw a party. While generally matter-of-fact, Cloudy Quartz cares deeply for her daughters, as seen in her willingness to seek Pinkie's help. She eventually becomes more receptive to new experiences and traditions, indicating a capacity for growth and acceptance, and a willingness to set aside tradition for the love of her family.\n",
