    "profile": "Limestone Pie is an Earth pony and one of Pinkie Pie's sisters. She has a grayish-purple coat, a gray mane, and green-brown eyes. As a filly, she lived on the family's rock farm and was initially shocked by but eventually joined in Pinkie Pie's first party. In her adulthood, Limestone's personality is aggressive as she fiercely protects the rock farm, especially Holder's Boulder.\n\nShe is typically seen with her younger sister Marble Pie, who is much shyer, although in later appearances Limestone shows a softer side when it comes to her sisters. She has appeared in many Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations with the Apple family and has assisted Pinkie with gift ideas.\n",
    "quotes": [
        "Gaze into the eyes of Limestone Pie. Ma and Pa may own this rock farm, but I keep it running.",
        "Stay off Holder's Boulder!",
        "What. Happened. To. My. Farm?!",
        "Well, don't just stand there! We got a boulder to move! And I'm in charge.",
        "You see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a gem. Even if you never see past his dullness, you can see how happy he makes Maud. And to a sister, that's all that matters."
