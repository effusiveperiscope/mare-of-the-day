    "profile": "Saffron Masala is a friendly and eager unicorn mare with a brilliant orange coat, a two-toned dark fuchsia mane, and moderate magenta eyes. She is the daughter of Coriander Cumin, and together they own The Tasty Treat, a restaurant in Canterlot serving Indian-inspired dishes. Saffron works as the chef, while her father usually hosts.\n\nInitially, Saffron has a strained relationship with her father due to his bitterness over the restaurant's poor business, leading to frequent arguments. However, with the help of Pinkie Pie and Rarity, they are able to mend their relationship by rediscovering their shared love of cooking and remembering why they opened The Tasty Treat in the first place. She later makes a brief appearance in the series finale in a group shot with Rarity, reaffirming the strength of their friendship.\n",

        "I'm Saffron Masala, the chef here at The Tasty Treat, the most exotic cuisine in Canterlot. Would you like to hear about the specials?",
        "Father, stop it! Don't close up the restaurant around our guests.",
        "Well, your attitude isn't going to bring anyone in! Can't you at least pretend to be positive?!",
        "That's all I've ever wanted to do, father! Make food for the ponies of Canterlot like the food we made together when I was younger!",
        "We've both been so stressed about the restaurant succeeding that we forgot what it was we loved about it in the first place."
