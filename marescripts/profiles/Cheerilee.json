    "profile": "Miss Cheerilee is a kind, patient, and moderately strict Earth pony who serves as the teacher at the Ponyville Schoolhouse. She has a moderate cerise coat, a pale pink mane with streaks of light gray, and gray-ish harlequin eyes. Her cutie mark is a large smiling flower with two small flowers and four leaves, which she explains represents her care for her students.\n\nCheerilee is a prominent supporting character in the series, often appearing in the background of various scenes and playing more significant roles in episodes such as \"Call of the Cutie\" and \"Hearts and Hooves Day.\" She is often seen interacting with the Cutie Mark Crusaders, guiding them on their journey to find their cutie marks, and occasionally reprimanding them for their mischievous behavior.\n",
