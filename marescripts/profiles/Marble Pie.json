    "profile": "Marble Pie is an Earth pony and the youngest sister of Pinkie Pie. She has a gray coat, dark gray mane, and grayish purple eyes. Marble is depicted as very shy and soft-spoken, often relying on Pinkie to speak for her. Her most notable characteristic is her laconic nature, frequently only saying \"Mm-hmm\" in response to conversation, which is similar to Big McIntosh.\n\nMarble is a member of the Pie family, who runs a rock farm. She is shown to be close with her sisters, including the aggressive Limestone Pie. She also develops a friendship with Big McIntosh and is saddened when seeing him kiss Sugar Belle under the mistletoe. She is also shown participating in Pie family traditions such as gift swap meets and making dolls out of rocks during Hearth's Warming Eve.\n",
